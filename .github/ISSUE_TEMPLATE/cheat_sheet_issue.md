<!-- Please fill out the issue title above. Cheat sheet development happens in bursts so you may not get a response immediately. 
Thank you for taking the time to ask a question or give feedback!

If you're looking to submit a new cheat sheet or a translation, read the contributing guidelines at 
https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md and submit a pull request.
You do not need to open an issue to do so.

If your question is about using the packages or functions featured in the cheat sheets instead of the cheat sheets themselves, 
please post your question on RStudio Community at https://community.rstudio.com/.
