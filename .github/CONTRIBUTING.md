## Contribute a New Cheat Sheet

Want to contribute a cheat sheet of your own?

Weâ€™d like to help you make and share high quality cheat sheets on R topics. The template below provides a useful starting place. It contains tips for designing a three or four column cheat sheet, as well as reusable elements to build your sheet with. Check out the [README](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/README.md) for more tips on making good cheat sheets.

If you make a cheat sheet, we encourage you to share it here with us! We accept and post cheat sheets on a volunteer basis. Each cheat sheet must be licensed under the [creative commons 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and be attributed to you, the author. Include "CC-BY-SA Your Name" somewhere on the cheat sheet.

To submit a finished cheat sheet, open a pull request!

We ask you include:  
* A PDF file of your cheat sheet
* A .png image of the first page of your cheat sheet 1100 x 850 (for the website thumbnail)
* The original Keynote, PowerPoint, or similar file if possible (for translators)

Cheat sheet pull requests and issues tend be handled in bursts, and we may wait for several to accumulate before sorting through them so don't worry if your submission sits for a while!
